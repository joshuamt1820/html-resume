        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Josh Thompson, and I am a designer from Denver, Colorado. I graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver with a BA in Art and minor in Interactive Media, but my focus is UI/UX and digital design. I love learning and exploring all different mediums of art, whether that be photography or exciting new AI art tools. Outside of design, I am very passionate about baseball, music, and going to the movies. I look to connect my passions to my designs anytime I can. I also love spending time playing with me and my partner's new puppy, Phoebee.</p>
